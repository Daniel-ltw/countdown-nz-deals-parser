countdown-nz-deals-parser
=========================

Was looking out for options to parse contents on a website and found jSoup. 
Currently, it should parse deals from the various webpage and provide users with a the required print out on the console. 
Users who know how to code, could even make use of the print writer to write out a file with all the deals in it. 

Additionally, I have worked with Google Drive Spreadsheet to consolidate all data retrieve over a number of weeks. 
If you are a consumer in New Zealand looking for cheap supermarket deals. 
That spreadsheet is for you. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16F9t-HncTzZlzcZPb_pU1pj-qWLCJurOo_FE2yf_Piw/edit?usp=sharing

In the spreadsheet, I have included Google Script functions to pick up the latest list that I have compiled on the deals for the specific week. 
The script would work itself to update the above mentioned spreadsheet with 2 different functions. 
One function would just update existing products a lower price, if such a case exist, and the other function is to insert new product if the product is not on the aboved mention spreadsheet. 

Please feel free to make any suggestions and I will look into it asap.
